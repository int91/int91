# Ogue info

Ogue is my current project in which I plan to release in a few years.

Ogue is a text-based sandbox rpg in which the player is thrown into a vast world with procedural elements and must determine their own quest.

The Game Development Document for Ogue is currently in the works, I am expecting a week or two to fully complete the document.

The project page for Ogue can be found here
