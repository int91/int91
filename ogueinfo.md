# Ogue info

Ogue is my current project in which I plan to release within a decent time period.

Ogue is a text-based/ui-driven Rogue-lite RPG in which the player is thrown into a vast world with procedural elements and must survive in a post-apocalyptic world.

The Game Development Document for Ogue is still in the works, I will release a summary of it once the game reaches a playable state.

The project page for Ogue can be found here
