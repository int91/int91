### A Little About Me
I am a former Professional Esports Competitor across the following games:
- Supraball
- Rogue Company
- Phantom Forces (Yes the Roblox game)
- Bad Business (Yep another Roblox game)
- Rocket League Sideswipe

I have played video games my whole life almost, starting back when I was only **3** years old.
I still play games all the time and am currently trying to get better at assetto corsa to be a good sim racer in the future.

### My Development History

I started Programming back in 2017 with C#. I taught myself how to make simple projects like 8-ball programs and mini-text adventure games. 
I taught myself through various online resources, one of those being YouTube of course.
I now try my best to **not** use YouTube as a resource for programming and stick to books or the specific language's/engine's documentation.
I believe that using YouTube with a certain mindset when trying to learn will produce a form of linear problem solving ability.
In programming it's ideal to not only learn your preferred language, but to also master problem solving, whether it's through techniques like narrowing things down to the minimal
components or just figuring out how to solve the problem through consistent methodology. You **need** to be able to solve problems when programming.

I currently have SoloLearn certs in Python (Basic usage), C#, and HTML. (Working on a Java cert)
I am also currently studying for the CompTIA Security+ Exam and plan to take the CompTIA A+ soon after.

I have created numerous projects shown in the table below.
You can find some of my projects on [itch.io](https://convulse.itch.io) [https://convulse.itch.io](https://convulse.itch.io)

### My Current Projects

- Focusing on a private project atm

#### Open-Source Projects

- [Cargo Transport Simulator](https://github.com/int91/CargoTransportSim) is a game in which you run your own Cargo Logistics company. Start out as a simple lonewolf business owner and work your way up to compete with the best in the logistics industry. Inspired by Euro Truck Simulator.

- The [True-Skill Ranking System](https://github.com/int91/TrueSkillRankingSystem) is a visible elo system designed to reward good performance as well as punish bad performance. This system uses every trackable statistic to determine your "True-Skill". Winning and Losing will no longer be the absolute game ender for ranked play.


I'm making my projects under the studio name (Not an actual studio, just a psuedonym for development.
