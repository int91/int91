# Project Invictus Info

Project Invictus is my current project in which I plan to release in a few years. The name isn't final, this is shown via the "Project" prefix.

Project Invictus is a game very similar to [Melvor Idle](https://melvoridle.com/index_ads.php), but the catch is... it's not an idle game.

The Game Development Document for Project Invictus is currently in the works, I am expecting a week or two to fully complete the document.
